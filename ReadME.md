### Case Scenario I

#### Question 1: Which product category had the highest sales?

* **SQL Query:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        product_category,
        SUM(sales) AS total_sales
    FROM
        public.orders
    GROUP BY
        product_category
    ORDER BY
        total_sales DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

* **Result:**
    ```text
    product_category | total_sales
    -----------------+-------------
    Technology       | 5984248.18
    ```
   
* **Insight/Interpretation:**
    The analysis reveals that **"Technology"** is the leading product category in terms of sales, generating a significant total revenue of **₦5,984,248.18** (assuming Nigerian Naira currency, adjust if different). This indicates a strong market demand for technology products within Kultra Mega Stores' operations during the 2009-2012 period. Management should consider leveraging this strength, perhaps through targeted promotions or expanding product lines within this category.



### Case Scenario I

#### Question 2: What are the Top 3 and Bottom 3 regions in terms of sales?

* **SQL Query (Top 3 Regions):**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        region,
        SUM(sales) AS total_sales
    FROM
        public.orders
    GROUP BY
        region
    ORDER BY
        total_sales DESC
    LIMIT 3;
    ```

* **Result (Top 3 Regions):**
    ```text
    region             | total_sales
    -------------------+--------------
    West               | 3597549.2755
    Ontario            | 3063212.4795
    Prarie             | 2837304.6015
    ```

* **SQL Query (Bottom 3 Regions):**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        region,
        SUM(sales) AS total_sales
    FROM
        public.orders
    GROUP BY
        region
    ORDER BY
        total_sales ASC
    LIMIT 3;
    ```

* **Result (Bottom 3 Regions):**
    ```text
    region                  | total_sales
    ------------------------+--------------
    Nunavut                 | 116376.4835
    Northwest Territories   | 800847.3295
    Yukon                   | 975867.3710
    ```

* **Insight/Interpretation:**
    The sales analysis by region highlights significant disparities in revenue generation across different geographical areas. The **"West," "Ontario," and "Prarie"** regions are clearly the top performers, contributing the most to overall sales. This suggests strong market presence and customer base in these areas.

    Conversely, **"Nunavut," "Northwest Territories," and "Yukon"** represent the bottom three regions in terms of sales. Their significantly lower sales figures indicate either a weaker market penetration, lower population density, or specific logistical/economic challenges. KMS management should investigate the reasons behind the low performance in these regions to identify potential areas for growth or, alternatively, to optimize resource allocation if market potential is genuinely limited.




### Case Scenario I

#### Question 3: What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?

* **SQL Query:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        SUM(sales) AS total_sales_appliances_ontario
    FROM
        public.orders
    WHERE
        product_category = 'Appliances' -- Ensure this matches the exact casing/spelling in your data
        AND province = 'Ontario';       -- Ensure this matches the exact casing/spelling in your data
    ```
    *(If you had to adjust the casing in your WHERE clause to get this result, it's good practice to add a small note about that in your `README.md` to show your troubleshooting process, e.g., "Note: Verified 'Appliances' and 'Ontario' casing to match data.")*

* **Result:**
    ```text
    total_sales_appliances_ontario
    ------------------------------
                       202346.84
    ```

* **Insight/Interpretation:**
    The total sales of **Appliances** specifically within the **Ontario** province amount to **₦202,346.84**. This provides a granular view of category performance in a particular region. While "Technology" is the overall highest-selling category, this figure allows KMS management to assess regional demand for specific product types and potentially tailor marketing or inventory strategies for Appliances in Ontario.




#### Question 4: Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase the revenue from the bottom 10 customers.

* **SQL Query (to identify customers):**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        customer_name,
        SUM(sales) AS total_customer_sales
    FROM
        public.orders
    GROUP BY
        customer_name
    ORDER BY
        total_customer_sales ASC
    LIMIT 10;
    ```

* **Result (Bottom 10 Customer List):**
    ```text
    "Jeremy Farry"      | 85.72
    "Natalie DeCherney" | 125.90
    "Nicole Fjeld"      | 153.03
    "Katrina Edelman"   | 180.76
    "Dorothy Dickinson" | 198.08
    "Christine Kargatis"| 293.22
    "Eric Murdock"      | 343.328
    "Chris McAfee"      | 350.18
    "Rick Huthwaite"    | 415.82
    "Mark Hamilton"     | 450.99
    ```

* **Advice to Management:**
    To increase revenue from customers like Jeremy Farry, Natalie DeCherney, and others on this list, KMS should consider a targeted approach focusing on engagement and value proposition:

    a.  **Personalized "Re-engagement" Campaigns:**
        * **Action:** Send personalized emails or SMS messages.
        * **Content:** Offer small, exclusive discounts (e.g., 5-10% off their next purchase), a special bundle tailored to their past (minimal) purchases, or a "we miss you" offer with a limited-time validity. The goal is to entice them back to make another purchase.

    b.  **Targeted Product Recommendations:**
        * **Action:** Analyze the types of products these customers *did* buy (even if small purchases).
        * **Content:** Recommend complementary products, new arrivals in categories they previously showed interest in, or essential office supplies/furniture that are frequently repurchased.

    c.  **Feedback Collection (Surveys):**
        * **Action:** Reach out to a sample of these customers with a short, incentivized survey (e.g., "Complete this 2-minute survey and get a small discount on your next order").
        * **Goal:** Understand *why* their spending is low. Is it pricing? Product availability? Customer service experience? Lack of awareness of the full product range? This direct feedback can provide invaluable insights.

    d.  **Introduce or Highlight Loyalty Programs/Benefits:**
        * **Action:** Clearly communicate the benefits of any KMS loyalty program or highlight advantages of being a regular customer (e.g., free shipping thresholds, exclusive early access to sales).
        * **Goal:** Provide an incentive for repeat purchases and increased spending.

    e.  **Re-evaluate Customer Segment Alignment:**
        * **Action:** For each of these customers, confirm their `customer_segment` (Consumer, Retail, Corporate).
        * **Consideration:** If they are small businesses or corporate clients, perhaps they were one-off purchases or their needs have changed. A targeted sales call might be appropriate for higher-potential segments.

    By understanding the "why" behind their low spending and offering tailored incentives, KMS can potentially convert these low-revenue customers into more valuable, recurring clients.



#### Question 5: KMS incurred the most shipping cost using which shipping method?

* **SQL Query:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        ship_mode,
        SUM(shipping_cost) AS total_shipping_cost_incurred
    FROM
        public.orders
    GROUP BY
        ship_mode
    ORDER BY
        total_shipping_cost_incurred DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

* **Result:**
    ```text
    ship_mode       | total_shipping_cost_incurred
    ----------------+------------------------------
    Delivery Truck  | 51971.94
    ```

* **Insight/Interpretation:**
    The analysis shows that **"Delivery Truck"** is the shipping method with the highest total incurred cost for KMS, amounting to **₦51,971.94**. This is an important finding, especially when considering operational efficiency and profitability. While delivery trucks might be preferred for certain types of goods or routes, their cumulative cost suggests they are a significant expense. Management should further investigate the factors contributing to this high cost, such as fuel efficiency, route optimization, maintenance, or labor costs associated with truck deliveries, to identify potential areas for cost reduction.




### Case Scenario II

#### Question 6: Who are the most valuable customers, and what products or services do they typically purchase?

To identify the most valuable customers, we focused on those with the highest total sales. Then, we analyzed their purchasing patterns.

* **SQL Query (Most Valuable Customers by Sales):**

        SUM(sales) AS total_customer_sales
    FROM
        public.orders
    GROUP BY
        customer_name
    ORDER BY
        total_customer_sales DESC
    LIMIT 5;
    ```

* **Result (Top 5 Most Valuable Customers):**
    ```text
    customer_name       | total_customer_sales
    --------------------+---------------------

        COUNT(*) AS number_of_orders_in_category
    FROM
        public.orders
    WHERE
        customer_name IN ('Emily Phan', 'Deborah Brumfield', 'Roy Skaria', 'Sylvia Foulston', 'Grant Carroll')
    GROUP BY
        customer_name,
        product_category
    ORDER BY
        customer_name,
        total_category_sales_for_customer DESC;
    ```

    Sylvia Foulston     | Office Supplies   | 11033.34                          | 9
    ```

* **Insight/Interpretation:**
    The most valuable customers for Kultra Mega Stores are **Emily Phan**, **Deborah Brumfield**, **Roy Skaria**, **Sylvia Foulston**, and **Grant Carroll**, based on their significant total sales contributions.

    Their purchasing patterns show distinct preferences:
    * **Technology Dominance:** Emily Phan and Deborah Brumfield heavily favor **Technology** products, accounting for a large portion of their overall spending.
    * **Furniture & Office Supplies:** Grant Carroll shows a strong preference for **Office Supplies** and **Furniture**. Roy Skaria and Sylvia Foulston also make substantial purchases in **Furniture** and **Technology**, with Office Supplies being their third preference.

    **Recommendations for Management:**
    * **Tailored Offers:** For customers like Emily Phan and Deborah Brumfield, KMS should continue to push new technology products, accessories, and upgrades.
    * **Cross-selling Opportunities:** For customers like Grant Carroll, Roy Skaria, and Sylvia Foulston, consider cross-selling strategies, perhaps bundling office supplies with furniture, or offering discounts on technology upgrades when they purchase large furniture items.
    * **Personalized Communication:** Understand the specific needs of these high-value customers and tailor communication and product showcases to their demonstrated preferences.



#### Question 7: Which small business customer had the highest sales?

* **SQL Query:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        customer_name,
        SUM(sales) AS total_customer_sales
    FROM
        public.orders
    WHERE
        customer_segment = 'Small Business'
    GROUP BY
        customer_name
    ORDER BY
        total_customer_sales DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

* **Result:**
    ```text
    customer_name | total_customer_sales
    --------------+---------------------
    Dennis Kane   | 75967.5905
    ```

* **Insight/Interpretation:**
    **Dennis Kane** is identified as the small business customer with the highest sales, contributing **₦75,967.59** to KMS revenue. This customer is a key asset within the small business segment. Management could consider reaching out to Dennis Kane directly to understand their needs better, offer personalized bulk discounts, or explore opportunities for upselling/cross-selling to further solidify this valuable relationship and potentially use them as a case study for attracting similar high-value small business clients.




#### Question 8: Which Corporate Customer placed the most number of orders in 2009 – 2012?

* **SQL Query:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        customer_name,
        COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders_placed
    FROM
        public.orders
    WHERE
        customer_segment = 'Corporate'
        AND order_date BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2012-12-31'
    GROUP BY
        customer_name
    ORDER BY
        total_orders_placed DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

* **Result:**
    ```text
    customer_name | total_orders_placed
    --------------+--------------------
    Adam Hart     | 27
    ```

* **Insight/Interpretation:**
    **Adam Hart** is identified as the Corporate Customer who placed the highest number of orders (27) between 2009 and 2012. This indicates Adam Hart is a highly engaged and consistent corporate client for KMS. Management should recognize this customer as a key relationship and explore opportunities for deepened engagement, perhaps through dedicated account management, exclusive previews of new corporate solutions, or loyalty incentives to maintain their high order frequency.



#### Question 9: Which consumer customer was the most profitable one?

* **SQL Query:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        customer_name,
        SUM(profit) AS total_customer_profit
    FROM
        public.orders
    WHERE
        customer_segment = 'Consumer'
    GROUP BY
        customer_name
    ORDER BY
        total_customer_profit DESC
    LIMIT 1;
    ```

* **Result:**
    ```text
    customer_name | total_customer_profit
    --------------+----------------------
    Emily Phan    | 34005.44
    ```

* **Insight/Interpretation:**
    **Emily Phan** emerges as the most profitable consumer customer for KMS, generating a total profit of **₦34,005.44**. It's noteworthy that Emily Phan also appeared as one of the overall most valuable customers by sales (from Question 6), reinforcing her importance to the business. This indicates a customer who not only purchases frequently but also tends to buy items with higher profit margins. KMS should prioritize retaining and nurturing this relationship, potentially through exclusive offers on high-margin products or personalized communication, to maximize long-term profitability.




#### Question 10: Which customer returned items, and what segment do they belong to?

* **SQL Query:**
    ```sql
    SELECT DISTINCT
        o.customer_name,
        o.customer_segment
    FROM
        public.orders AS o
    JOIN
        public.order_status AS os ON o.order_id = os.order_id
    WHERE
        os.status = 'Returned';
    ```

* **Result:**
    The query returned **419 unique customers** who have returned items. These customers belong to various segments including:
    * Home Office
    * Corporate
    * Small Business
    * Consumer

    
    ```text
    customer_name   | customer_segment
    ----------------+-----------------
    Edward Nazzal   | Home Office
    Cindy Chapman   | Corporate
    Henry Goldwyn   | Small Business
    Julie Prescott  | Home Office
    Liz Willingham  | Home Office
    ```

* **Insight/Interpretation:**
    A substantial number of customers, totaling **419 individuals/entities**, have returned items to KMS. These returns are not isolated to a single customer segment but are observed across **Home Office, Corporate, Small Business, and Consumer** segments. This indicates a widespread issue or characteristic behavior rather than a segment-specific problem.

    **Recommendations for Management:**
    * **Investigate Root Causes:** KMS should delve deeper into the reasons for these returns. Is it due to product quality issues, incorrect orders, late deliveries, product not meeting expectations, or complex return policies? Analyzing `product_id` and `reason` (if available in another table) for returned orders could provide more specific insights.
    * **Segment-Specific Strategies:** While returns are broad, specific strategies might be needed per segment. For instance, Home Office clients might value clear product descriptions, while Corporate clients might need more accurate bulk order fulfillment.
    * **Return Policy Review:** Evaluate the existing return policy to ensure it is clear, fair, and not inadvertently encouraging returns.
    * **Feedback Loop:** Implement a system to capture feedback from customers during the return process to continuously improve products, services, and fulfillment.


#### Question 11: If the delivery truck is the most economical but the slowest shipping method and Express Air is the fastest but the most expensive one, do you think the company appropriately spent shipping costs based on the Order Priority? Explain your answer.

* **SQL Query for Analysis:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
        order_priority,
        ship_mode,
        SUM(shipping_cost) AS total_shipping_cost_for_priority,
        COUNT(order_id) AS number_of_orders_for_priority_ship_mode
    FROM
        public.orders
    GROUP BY
        order_priority,
        ship_mode
    ORDER BY
        order_priority ASC,
        total_shipping_cost_for_priority DESC;
    ```

* **Result:**
    ```text
    order_priority | ship_mode      | total_shipping_cost_for_priority | number_of_orders_for_priority_ship_mode
    ---------------+----------------+----------------------------------+-----------------------------------------
    Critical       | Delivery Truck | 10783.82                         | 228
    Critical       | Regular Air    | 8586.76                          | 1180
    Critical       | Express Air    | 1742.10                          | 200
    High           | Delivery Truck | 11206.88                         | 248
    High           | Regular Air    | 10005.01                         | 1308
    High           | Express Air    | 1453.53                          | 212
    Low            | Delivery Truck | 11131.61                         | 250
    Low            | Regular Air    | 10263.62                         | 1280
    Low            | Express Air    | 1551.63                          | 190
    Medium         | Delivery Truck | 9461.62                          | 205
    Medium         | Regular Air    | 9418.72                          | 1225
    Medium         | Express Air    | 1633.59                          | 201
    Not Specified  | Regular Air    | 9734.08                          | 1277
    Not Specified  | Delivery Truck | 9388.01                          | 215
    Not Specified  | Express Air    | 1470.06                          | 180
    ```

* **Insight/Explanation:**
    Based on the analysis, it appears that **KMS is NOT optimally or appropriately spending shipping costs based on Order Priority**, particularly for high-priority orders.

    **Key Observations:**
    a.  **Mismatch for High and Critical Priorities:**
        * For both "Critical" and "High" priority orders, the **Delivery Truck** (described as the slowest and most economical method) consistently incurs the *highest total shipping cost*. This is counter-intuitive for urgent orders, where speed should theoretically outweigh cost-per-shipment considerations.
        * The fastest and most expensive method, **Express Air**, consistently has the *lowest total shipping cost* and the *lowest number of orders* across *all* priority levels, including "Critical" and "High". This strongly suggests it is being underutilized for urgent shipments, where its speed would be most beneficial, despite its higher individual cost.
    b.  **Reliance on Regular Air:** "Regular Air" appears to be the workhorse for all priority levels, handling the vast majority of orders. While this might be a balanced approach for medium to low priorities, its heavy use for "Critical" and "High" orders (despite `Delivery Truck` having higher *total* cost) still implies that the fastest option (Express Air) is not being chosen when urgency is paramount.
    c.  **Appropriate for Low/Medium/Not Specified:** For "Low," "Medium," and "Not Specified" priorities, the higher usage and total cost for "Delivery Truck" and "Regular Air" are more justifiable, as these orders are less time-sensitive, and cost efficiency would be a higher priority.

    **Conclusion and Recommendations:**
    The current spending pattern indicates a potential disconnect between stated order priority and the chosen shipping method. KMS might be sacrificing delivery speed for urgent orders to save on per-shipment costs, which could negatively impact customer satisfaction for critical deliveries.

    Management should:
    * **Review Shipping Policies:** Establish clearer guidelines for selecting shipping methods based on Order Priority, ensuring that "Critical" and "High" priority orders are consistently routed via faster (even if individually more expensive) options like "Express Air."
    * **Cost-Benefit Analysis for Urgency:** Conduct a detailed cost-benefit analysis comparing the increased shipping cost of "Express Air" for critical orders against the potential loss of customer satisfaction, repeat business, or contractual penalties due to slow delivery.
    * **Optimize Delivery Truck Use:** While economical, if "Delivery Truck" has the highest *total* cost for urgent orders, it may indicate inefficiencies in routing, capacity utilization, or a need to shift some of these urgent orders to faster, albeit pricier, modes.




## 4. Key Findings & Recommendations

This sales and order analysis for Kultra Mega Stores (KMS) from 2009 to 2012 provides critical insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and operational efficiency across various segments and regions.

### Key Findings:

* **Dominant Product Category:** **Technology** emerged as the highest-selling product category, indicating strong market demand and a core revenue driver for KMS.
* **Regional Performance Disparities:** Sales are highly concentrated, with **"West," "Ontario," and "Prarie"** being the top-performing regions, while **"Nunavut," "Northwest Territories," and "Yukon"** significantly lag behind, highlighting uneven market penetration.
* **High-Value Customer Profiles:**
    * **Emily Phan** stands out as both the **most valuable overall customer by sales** and the **most profitable consumer customer**, making her a crucial asset. Her primary purchases are in **Technology**.
    * **Deborah Brumfield** (Technology) is another top valuable customer.
    * **Grant Carroll** primarily drives sales in **Office Supplies** and **Furniture**.
    * **Dennis Kane** is the top-performing customer within the **Small Business** segment.
    * **Adam Hart** placed the most orders among **Corporate** customers, demonstrating consistent engagement.
* **Customer Retention Opportunity (Bottom Performers):** A defined group of **bottom 10 customers** contributes minimally to revenue, suggesting potential for targeted re-engagement.
* **Significant Returns Activity:** A considerable number of customers (**419 unique customers**) across all segments (Consumer, Corporate, Small Business, Home Office) have returned items, indicating a potentially widespread issue in product satisfaction or fulfillment.
* **Suboptimal Shipping Cost Management:** Despite "Delivery Truck" being the slowest and most economical, it incurs the highest *total* shipping costs for **"Critical" and "High" priority orders**. Conversely, "Express Air" (fastest, most expensive) is significantly underutilized for these urgent shipments. This suggests a disconnect between order priority and shipping method selection.

### Overall Recommendations:

a.  **Capitalize on Strengths:**
    * **Invest in Technology Segment:** Continue to prioritize inventory, marketing, and new product introductions within the Technology category, leveraging its high demand and profitability.
    * **Deepen Engagement with Top Customers:** Implement personalized loyalty programs, exclusive offers, and dedicated account management for high-value customers like Emily Phan, Deborah Brumfield, Dennis Kane, and Adam Hart, tailored to their specific purchasing behaviors.

b.  **Address Underperforming Areas:**
    * **Regional Strategy Review:** Investigate the reasons for low sales in regions like Nunavut, Northwest Territories, and Yukon. This might involve market research, targeted marketing campaigns, or re-evaluation of logistical feasibility.
    * **Bottom Customer Re-engagement:** Develop specific re-engagement campaigns (e.g., targeted discounts, personalized recommendations, feedback surveys) to encourage repeat purchases from low-revenue customers.

c.  **Optimize Operations & Customer Satisfaction:**
    * **Investigate Return Root Causes:** Conduct a comprehensive analysis of returned items to identify underlying issues (e.g., product quality, inaccurate descriptions, fulfillment errors) and develop strategies to reduce return rates across all customer segments.
    * **Refine Shipping Strategy:** Re-evaluate the shipping method selection process, particularly for high-priority orders. Ensure that faster, more appropriate shipping methods (like Express Air) are utilized for "Critical" and "High" priority orders, even if individual costs are higher, to maintain customer satisfaction and service level agreements. A detailed cost-benefit analysis comparing expedited shipping with customer retention and satisfaction should be performed.
    * **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Continuously monitor key performance indicators (KPIs) related to sales, customer segments, shipping costs, and returns to ensure ongoing strategic alignment and identify new opportunities or challenges.
